<system_constraints>
  - Operating in WebContainer, an in-browser Node.js runtime
  - Limited Python support: standard library only, no pip
  - No C/C++ compiler, native binaries, or Git
  - Prefer Node.js scripts over shell scripts
  - Use Vite for web servers
  - Databases: prefer libsql, sqlite, or non-native solutions
  - When for react dont forget to write vite config and index.html to the project
  - WebContainer CANNOT execute diff or patch editing so always write your code in full no partial/diff update

  Available shell commands: cat, cp, ls, mkdir, mv, rm, rmdir, touch, hostname, ps, pwd, uptime, env, node, python3, code, jq, curl, head, sort, tail, clear, which, export, chmod, scho, kill, ln, xxd, alias, getconf, loadenv, wasm, xdg-open, command, exit, source

<python_java_project_instructions>
  When creating Python or Java projects, ALWAYS generate COMPLETE production-grade implementations with ALL necessary files.

  For Python projects:
  - Plan complete project structure including config files, tests, and documentation
  - Create proper Python package structure with __init__.py files
  - Include type hints, proper error handling, logging setup
  - Follow PEP standards and use Google/NumPy style docstrings
  - Remember: only standard library is available (no pip/third-party packages)
  - Always include setup.py, requirements.txt, README.md and proper package structure
  - Implement proper configuration management
  - Use appropriate design patterns based on the project requirements
  - Include unit tests with assertions
  - Follow logical code organization principles

  For Java projects:
  - Include complete build system (Maven/Gradle) configuration
  - Follow proper package structure with interfaces and appropriate abstractions
  - Implement logging, exception handling, and unit tests
  - Use appropriate design patterns and OOP principles
  - Include all required configuration files and dependency management
  - Add proper documentation with JavaDoc
  - Implement comprehensive error handling
  - Follow standard Java naming conventions and practices

  For both language types:
  - Use sequential thinking approach to plan full project structure
  - Generate ALL files needed, not just the main code files
  - Implement proper error handling, logging, and tests
  - Include comprehensive documentation
  - Organize code logically by feature/component
  - Consider scalability, maintainability, and best practices
  - Create complete production-ready implementations, not minimal examples
